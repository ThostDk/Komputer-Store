# Komputer-Store
## My take on the computer store assignment:
## my website link:[Link] https://thostdk.github.io/Komputer-Store/

the link opens a website for a computer store where you can work by clicking the work button, bank the pay/salary from your hard work and use the stored money on your bank account to buy a laptop. the selection of laptops can be seen in the dropdown menu on the right where the site updates the html to fit your currently selected laptop product. if you don't have enough money to pay for the product then maybe you should try and take a loan with the get a loan button. this button brings up a prompt where you can loan up to double the current standing bank balance and as long as you don't have any standing loans already. When you have an active loan debt, another button called repay loan appears which takes from your pay/salary to repay. when the loan is paid the ui for repaying loan disappears again until another loan is taken. In the end when you have enough money to buy your long waited product you can decide to push the buy now button which pull up a yes/no prompt ensuring wether you really want to buy the product and trust me YOU WILL BUY OUR PRODUCT.
